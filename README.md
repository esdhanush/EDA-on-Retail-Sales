# EDA-on-Retail-Sales
I have done an Exploratory Data Analysis on the transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. 

Perspectives:
- Clustering of transaction dataset based on its initial features (CustomersID, InvoiceDate,etc), apply PCA, feature selection.
- Create new features (Time, Day of week, Month) to explore customers behavior per time/day.
